<h4>Dates</h4>

The Master Class will take place at IRMA in Stradbourg from May 23 to May 27.

<h4>Aims and scope</h4>

Modelling with Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is widely used in
many scientific fields. It extends from the traditional domains such
as the mechanics, physics and geometry, to new areas, e.g. the
economy, social, and life sciences. The master class offers four
courses, of 5H each, to students in the masters of mathematics and
PhD-students.  The main objective of the masterclass is to provide an
overall picture of the modelling with PDEs and to give some research
perspectives to the participants.

    <h4>Plenary Speakers</h4>
		<br/>

    <li> Yves Achdou (LJLL, UPMC))</li>
 <li> Pierre Cardaliaguet (CEREMADE, Paris-Dauphine)</li>
 <li> Ralph Chill (TU, Dresden)</li>
 <li> Delphine Salort (LCQB, UPMC)</li>



<h4>Topics</h4>

<li>      Gradient Systems and Applications</li>
<li>      Mean Field Games</li>
<li>      Numerical Methods and Approximation</li>
<li>      Modelling the Dynamics of Interacting Neurons in a Network</li>


<h4>Location</h4>

IRMA's building is located in the main campus of Strasbourg University
(see the map and the map) . The master classes will be held in the
conference room of this building.

<h4>Financial support</h4>

Financial support for undergraduate and graduate students will be
available, to cover the accomodation expenses, and a limited number of
travel expenses. We also encourage all participants to seek financial
support for travel from their home institutions.
