Thanks to the funding of
[AMIES](http://www.agence-maths-entreprises.fr/a/?q=fr), we start a
year collaboration with PlasticOmnium Auto Exterior (Sigmatech) on a
Non Standard Navier Stokes formulation in Feel++ (NS2++).


In this project, we seek to put in place the building blocks required
to a strategy of solve in a non-standard way the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations.  It would allow PlasticOmnium (PO) to
increase the time they can study flows from 1s now to 10s with the
same budget on grids of the order of 100 million cells. The goal at
the end of the project is to have *(i)* developed the computational framework,
*(ii)* developed the necessary Feel++ software bricks  and *(iii)* tested
on some benchmarks from PO.
